abstract = {A new method for the accurate determination of the symmetric coefficients of the wave aberration function has been developed. The relative defoci and displacements of images in a focus series are determined from an analysis of the phase correlation function between pairs of images, allowing the restoration of an image wave even when focus and specimen drift are present. Subsequently, the absolute coefficients of both defocus and 2-fold astigmatism are determined with a phase contrast index function. Overall this method allows a very accurate automated aberration determination even for largely crystalline samples with little amorphous contamination. Using experimental images of the complex oxide Nb16W18O94 we have demonstrated the new method and critically compared it with existing diffractogram based aberration determinations. A series of protocols for practical implementation is also given together with a detailed analysis of the accuracy achieved. Finally a focal series restoration of Nb16W18O94 with symmetric aberrations determined automatically using this method is presented.},

abstract = {A new method is presented for the determination of the antisymmetric coefficients of the wave aberration function from a tableau of tilted illumination images. The approach is based on measurements of the apparent defocus and two-fold astigmatism using a phase correlation function and phase contrast index calculated from a short focus series acquired at each tilt. This method is shown to be suitable for a wide range of specimens and is sufficiently accurate for exit plane wave restoration at 0.1 nm resolution. Experimental examples of this approach are provided and the method is compared to results obtained from measurements of conventional power spectra. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The resolving power of the electron microscope and the contrast in the image are calculated for different conditions of focusing, illumination and aperture. These conditions can change the limit of resolution by a factor of about 3. The contrast in the image of an atom is appreciably increased by defocusing and spherical aberration. Nevertheless, the contrast improves when the numerical value of the aberration constant is diminished. The effect of different methods of spherical correction is discussed briefly.},

@article{Humphry2012,
abstract = {Diffractive imaging, in which image-forming optics are replaced by an inverse computation using scattered intensity data, could, in principle, realize wavelength-scale resolution in a transmission electron microscope. However, to date all implementations of this approach have suffered from various experimental restrictions. Here we demonstrate a form of diffractive imaging that unshackles the image formation process from the constraints of electron optics, improving resolution over that of the lens used by a factor of five and showing for the first time that it is possible to recover the complex exit wave (in modulus and phase) at atomic resolution, over an unlimited field of view, using low-energy (30 keV) electrons. Our method, called electron ptychography, has no fundamental experimental boundaries: further development of this proof-of-principle could revolutionize sub-atomic scale transmission imaging.},

@article{Rose2009,
abstract = {A brief history of the development of direct aberration correction in electron microscopy is outlined starting from the famous Scherzer theorem established in 1936. Aberration correction is the long story of many seemingly fruitless efforts to improve the resolution of electron microscopes by compensating for the unavoidable resolution-limiting aberrations of round electron lenses over a period of 50 years. The successful breakthrough, in 1997, can be considered as a quantum step in electron microscopy because it provides genuine atomic resolution approaching the size of the radius of the hydrogen atom. The additional realization of monochromators, aberration-free imaging energy filters and spectrometers has been leading to a new generation of analytical electron microscopes providing elemental and electronic information about the object on an atomic scale.},

@article{Batson2002,
abstract = {Following the invention of electron optics during the 1930s, lens aberrations have limited the achievable spatial resolution to about 50 times the wavelength of the imaging electrons. This situation is similar to that faced by Leeuwenhoek in the seventeenth century, whose work to improve the quality of glass lenses led directly to his discovery of the ubiquitous "animalcules" in canal water, the first hints of the cellular basis of life. The electron optical aberration problem was well understood from the start, but more than 60 years elapsed before a practical correction scheme for electron microscopy was demonstrated, and even then the remaining chromatic aberrations still limited the resolution. We report here the implementation of a computer-controlled aberration correction system in a scanning transmission electron microscope, which is less sensitive to chromatic aberration. Using this approach, we achieve an electron probe smaller than 1 A. This performance, about 20 times the electron wavelength at 120 keV energy, allows dynamic imaging of single atoms, clusters of a few atoms, and single atomic layer 'rafts' of atoms coexisting with Au islands on a carbon substrate. This technique should also allow atomic column imaging of semiconductors, for detection of single dopant atoms, using an electron beam with energy below the damage threshold for silicon.},

abstract = {In order to do any sort of computer processing of the images produced by an electron microscope they have to be digitized. Therefore, any form of microscopy that involves computer processing has to be considered as digital microscopy independently of whether the original images were recorded on film and scanned or recorded directly on a digital medium such as the charge coupled device (CCD). As soon as one digitizes images, one encounters a range of effects and artefacts specific to the digital world such as aliasing, quantization errors, and ambiguities in the modulation transfer function. Even a quick discussion of these effects makes it clear that what comes out of a digitizer is not related in a simple way to what goes in. After introducing the commonly used recording media, I will discuss the most important effects of digitization and then compare the limitations and advantages of the different recording media for various applications.},

It consists of an iterative procedure in which the linear and non-linear contributions to HRTEM images of a defocus series are optimally separated which will allow to benefit from a fast linear reconstruction scheme in which the non-linear contribution is corrected for in a self-consistent way. The method has proven to be a fast and workable algorithm for quantitative wave function reconstruction with direct resolution improvement. Results are shown for wave function reconstruction on experimentally acquired defocus series for a 200 keV FEG-TEM with a point-to-point resolution of 0.24 nm. In the reconstructed wave functions the resolution could clearly be enhanced up to 0.14 nm.},
