# Phase Reconstruction from TEM Defocus images


This MATLAB programme takes series of data from the user as input and returns recostructed phase image. Till now only symmetric wave function has been corrected. Unsymmetric wavefunction will be "next".

phasor_doc folder contains detailed TEX file and pdf file as well for the PHASOR program.

Would try to make it full fledged program when I get time.

PR welcome!
